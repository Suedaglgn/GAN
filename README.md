## GAN
A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning 
frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in June 2014.
Two neural networks contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game, 
where one agent's gain is another agent's loss.

The GAN model architecture involves two sub-models: a generator model for generating new examples and a discriminator model for classifying whether generated examples are real, from the domain, or fake, generated by the generator model.

- Generator. Model that is used to generate new plausible examples from the problem domain. 
- Discriminator. Model that is used to classify examples as real (from the domain) or fake (generated).

Main examples:

- **Image Super-Resolution** The ability to generate high-resolution versions of input images. 
- **Creating Art** The ability to great new and artistic images, sketches, painting, and more. 
- **Image-to-Image Translation** The ability to translate photographs across domains, such as day to night, summer to winter, and more.
